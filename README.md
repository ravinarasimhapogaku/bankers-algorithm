Banker's Algorithm
This is an implementation of the Banker's algorithm in Python. The Banker's algorithm is a deadlock avoidance algorithm that is used in operating systems to manage resources efficiently.

Requirements
Python 3.6 or later

Usage
Clone the repository
Run python3 banker.py

The program reads in an input file input.txt that contains the following information:

The number of processes
The number of resources
The maximum demand of each process in a matrix
The allocation matrix
The available resources

The program then performs the Banker's algorithm to check if the system is in a safe state or not. If the system is in a safe state, the program will output a sequence of processes that can be executed safely.
