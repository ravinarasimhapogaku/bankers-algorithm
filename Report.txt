Report for the Multi-threaded Program that Implements the Banker's Algorithm
The Banker's Algorithm is a resource allocation and deadlock avoidance algorithm. The algorithm is used by operating systems to 
safely allocate resources to processes, while avoiding deadlock. This report analyzes a multithreaded program that implements the Banker's Algorithm
 using the C programming language.

Program Description
The program starts by asking the user to input the number of processes and resources that the system has.
It then requests the number of available resources for each resource type. The program then proceeds to request the resources allocated and the 
maximum resources required for each process. The need matrix is calculated using the maximum required and allocated resources. The program then attempts to
find a safe sequence using the getSafeSeq() function. If a safe sequence is found, the program proceeds to execute the processes in the safe sequence. Otherwise, the program exits.

Program Components
The program is composed of the following components:

Main function
getSafeSeq() function
processCode() function
Main Function
The main function is the starting point of the program. It starts by requesting the number of processes and resources, and 
the available resources for each resource type. The allocated and maximum required resources are then requested. The need matrix is calculated, and 
the program attempts to find a safe sequence using the getSafeSeq() function. If a safe sequence is found, the program proceeds to execute the processes in the safe sequence.
Otherwise, the program exits.

getSafeSeq() Function
The getSafeSeq() function attempts to find a safe sequence for the given system state. It does this by checking if each process can finish execution with the available resources.
If a process can finish execution, its resources are released and added to the available resources, and the process is marked as finished. This process is repeated until all processes are
finished, or until there are no more processes that can finish execution with the available resources. If a safe sequence is found, it is returned. Otherwise, -1 is returned.

processCode() Function
The processCode() function simulates the execution of a process. It requests the required resources, and if they are available, the process executes for a random amount of time.
Once the process is finished, it releases its resources and updates the available resources.

Thread Management
The program uses POSIX threads to execute the processes in the safe sequence. Each process is executed in a separate thread.
The main thread waits for all threads to finish execution before terminating the program.

Synchronization
The program uses a mutex lock and a condition variable to synchronize access to shared resources. The lockResources mutex is used to protect access to the resources array,
allocated matrix, maxRequired matrix, need matrix, and safeSeq array. The condition variable is used to signal when resources become available. When a process requests resources that
are not available, it waits on the condition variable until the resources become available.

Functionality
The program functions correctly and implements the banker's algorithm using multithreading. The program correctly determines if a safe sequence exists and runs the processes in the
safe sequence.

Efficiency
The program uses multithreading to execute the processes in parallel, which can lead to significant performance improvements. The program efficiently checks if the resources required by
a process are available and puts the process on hold if the resources are not available.
Conclusion
The program successfully implements the Banker's Algorithm to safely allocate resources to processes while avoiding deadlock. The program uses POSIX threads to execute the processes in
the safe sequence. The program uses a mutex lock and a condition variable to synchronize access to shared resources.
